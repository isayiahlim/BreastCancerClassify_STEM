 * It is suggested that you work on the methods in the following order:
 * 	1) calculateDistance - once you finish this, you should see a
 * 	   graph of distances appear!
 * 	2) getAllDistances
 * 	3) findKClosestEntries
 * 	4) classify
 *  5) kNearestNeighbors (use your helpers correctly!)
 *  6) getAccuracy
